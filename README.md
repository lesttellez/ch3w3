in week 3, we are modifying given code to generate a unique password.

i started with adding variables that hold arrays from lower case letters , capital letters, numbers, and special characters..etc

i then moved foward with creating function to show my prompts. in the promts i asked question towards how many characters, how many upper - lower case letters, how many numbers, and special charaters they would like, if any.

i then wrote a funtion for any thing that the user selected to be 'ok' from the promts, then would be used to generate the password.

finally i added a function and event listener to then show generated password and look for any clicks in order to start working through the prompts
